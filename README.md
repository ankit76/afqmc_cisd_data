# Data for "Beyond CCSD(T) accuracy at lower scaling with auxiliary Ô¨Åeld quantum Monte Carlo"

Each directory corresponds to a section in the results section of the paper. We provide absolute energies (in a.u.) if not reported in the main text, and example input and output files for PySCF and AFQMC calculations.

## Software used:

-   [PySCF](https://github.com/pyscf/pyscf)
-   [ad_afqmc](https://github.com/ankit76/ad_afqmc)
